# Advent of Code, 2020 :christmas_tree:
My implementations of the [2020 Advent of Code] puzzles in [R].

I like to use the Advent of Code as a learning opportunity. This year, I
decided on learning [R]. I have zero experience with the language.

Because I'm using this as an opportunity to learn R, I'm going to try to avoid
bringing in external dependencies. I'm sure some of these puzzles could be
simplified by pulling in some external package, but then I would be doing
myself a disservice.

As another benefit, my solutions are completely self-contained. Each day is in
their associated directory, and, within those directories, are `part1.r` and
`part2.r` files to solve the parts. These files have no external dependencies
whatsoever, not even to my own code. So, for someone who is having trouble
solving an AoC puzzle, you won't have to hunt around my repo or read package
documentation to understand my solution; everything is in one file... though, I
can't speak much to my code quality =)
